    <h3>Vegan Pad Thai Noodles.</h3>
    <p>This is my go to recipe when I need something quick and satisfying. I have made this over a gazillion times now and the way we jump on it, I never got a chance to manage a decent image. The authentic way is to use fish sauce for the flavour, but I am glad to share a vegan version of it and something that’s suits my palate. I didn’t use tofu here because the husband is not too fond of it but feel free to add pressed and sautéed tofu if you prefer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 Gms Thick rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 Cup Mixed veggies - see notes</li>
        <li>6-7 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Cup Bean sprouts</li>
        <li>6-7 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>3 Tbsps Groundnut oil</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Red chilli flakes</li>




        <li>2-3 Pcs Red thai chillies</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to Make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 200 gms thick rice noodles in boiling hot water for 15 mins.</li>
        <li>Chop 1 cup veggies of choice -  I used carrots, capsicum, onions (can use broccoli, red or yellow peppers, zucchini and more).</li>
        <li>Mince 6-7 garlic cloves and 2-3 red Thai chillies.</li>
        <li>Dry roast 1/3 cup of peanuts and crush them in a chopper. Keep some aside for garnish.</li>
        <li>Sauce mix - 2.5 tbsps soy sauce, 3 tbsps tamarind pulp, 1.5 tsp miso paste (optional), 2 tbsps raw sugar or brown sugar, salt and black pepper to taste. Whisk all of this together and keep aside.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat 3 tbsps of groundnut oil and add the minced garlic and 1 tsp red chilli flakes. Add and sauté onion slices for a min. on medium high flame. Mix in the rest of the veggies and sauté for another 2-3 mins or until the veggies are tender yet crunchy.</li>
        <li>Mix in 1 cup of bean sprouts and let it cook for 2 mins on medium flame. Tip in the sauce mix, crushed peanuts and the soaked and drained rice noodles. Using tongs mix it all well. Let it cook for another 2 mins.</li>





        <li>Garnish with more bean sprouts, roasted peanuts, chilli oil or chilli sauce, cilantro and lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
