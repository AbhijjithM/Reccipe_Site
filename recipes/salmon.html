    <h3>Sticky sweet and garlicky, this glazed salmon recipe comes together in just 20 minutes</h3>
    <p>We all know how nutritious salmon is… loaded with omega 3’s, high in protein and tons of vitamins, so I’m glad I can enjoy those benefits.  And now, so can you!

        You won’t believe how such a simple recipe can pack SO much flavor.  Each bite is full of sweet and savory flavors and delicate textures.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SALMON</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sriracha sauce</li>


        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to Make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat salmon filets dry and season with spices on all sides.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and oil, then add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>When hot, add salmon filets (skin side down if your filets have skin), and cook 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>While salmon cooks, use a spoon to baste the filets.</li>
        <li>Broil for 5-6 minutes, until salmon is sticky sweet, slightly charred, and cooked to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Buy good salmon – I prefer to buy fresh salmon from the grocery store, instead of frozen filets in bags, since those tend to be very thin.  Cooking Light has a great article on how to pick the best salmon at the grocery store.</li>
        <li>Use it quickly – Salmon can go “off” or bad pretty quickly, so I prefer to buy my salmon no more than 1 day ahead of time.</li>
        <li>Pan-Sear – if you’d prefer, season salmon as directed, then pan sear in the pan.  Flip over and sear on the other side, then remove to a plate.  Add sauce ingredients to pan and cook until warmed through.  Add salmon back to pan and spoon sauce over the salmon.</li>
        <li>Don’t overcook </li>

    </ol>
